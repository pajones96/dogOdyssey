# dogOdyssey
Doing the whole dog-and-pony show of a scratch-to-finished-product full-stack application.

Going to be using Spring-boot and Java on the backend, Vue.js on the frontend.
The plan is to eventually make this function as a main website for my personal company, Augury Solutions.
It should include information about the company and services provided, a portfolio, a professional blog, and ways to contact me.
